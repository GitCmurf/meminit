# Writing Style Guide

- Commit messages: imperative voice ("Add", "Fix", "Refactor").
- Document change logs: past tense summaries ("Added", "Fixed").
- Prefer short sentences, active voice, and concrete nouns.
- Use inclusive, reader-first language; avoid weasel words (checked by Vale).
- Code/paths/commands in backticks; wrap at ~100 chars for readability.

Run `vale docs/` to lint prose locally.
