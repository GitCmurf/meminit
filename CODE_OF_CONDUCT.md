# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (issue tracker, pull
requests, documentation, chat) and when an individual is officially
representing the project in public.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as
possible to conduct@meminit.io. Include links/screenshots if available
and state whether you want the report to be confidential. Reports will receive
an acknowledgement within 72 hours.

## Enforcement Process

The project maintainers will investigate all complaints. The reporter will receive an update on the investigation stage (though not necessarily the details) within one week. If the decision results in an enforcement action, the recipient will be notified.

**Appeals**: Recipients of an enforcement decision may appeal within 30 days of notification by contacting the Project Leadership. If the appeal involves Project Leadership, the maintainers will appoint an independent reviewer (a maintainer not involved in the decision, or an external reviewer if needed). Appeals will be reviewed based on new context or evidence, and decisions on appeal are final. Leaders will maintain confidentiality to the extent possible and may consult
subject-matter experts when needed. The reporter will be informed of the
outcome.
